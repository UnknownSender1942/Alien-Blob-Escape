**Alien Blob Escape** is a creative reimagining of the classic Snake game, where you control a weird, morphing alien blob inside a hostile alien biome. Instead of rigid square movement, the blob is rendered fluidly with dynamic visuals, glowing effects, and a trail system.

This is an **early prototype**, with core mechanics implemented using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS.
